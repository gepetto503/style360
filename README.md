Stylin' On You

A responsive landing page for stylists (hair/beauty) built in React with Sass.

This project was an exercise in:
- setting up an environment with create-react-app and sass
- responsive styling (mobile, tablet and desktop)
- passing data down the component tree using props (all the data is in an object inside an input-data.js file, passed into the app component as a prop and then broken up into smaller chunks of data and passed to the appropriate component to be used).
